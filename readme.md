# Jellyfin Downloader

This is a simple tool written in Go to download a Series or a single season from a given jellyfin instance. 

## Disclaimer

Since I've written this in order to learn go, not everything might be very written _as it should_. Also keep in mind
that not everything might be work as expected. 

## Usage

You can use multiple methods to specify the series you want to download. 

The simplest method is to just specify a name of the series you want to get: 

```bash
jellyfindownloader -url <BaseURL of the JF Server> -name <Partial or Full Name of the Show>
```

Another way is to specify the series Id. 
To obtain the Id of the show you want to download, you first have to navigate to the shows main page
in the jellyfin web client. After opening the shows main page, you can extract the seriesId from the URL: 

```
http://localhost:8096/web/index.html#!/details?

id=e9c503bbdb25e07b71e0168298402e18 <-- This is the ID you need to copy

&context=tvshows&serverId=da596f62e19b4ee296431dc373bad050
```

To download all episodes of a given series, call the tool like so: 

```bash
jellyfindownloader \
    -url <BaseURL of the JF Server> \
    -seriesid <ID of the series you want to download> 
```

If you only want to download a specific season, you have to find out the season Id first. You can also find the season ID in the URL when clicking on the season you want to download: 

```
http://localhost:8096/web/index.html#!/details?

id=5a0e9809ef72219c159e130235e9940d <-- This is the ID you need to copy&

serverId=da596f62e19b4ee296431dc373bad050
```

To download a specific episode, you need to call the tool like this: 

```bash
jellyfindownloader \
    -url <BaseURL of the JF Server> \
    -seriesid <ID of the series you want to download> \
    -seasonid <ID of the season to download>
```

You can also pass additional argument such as the username or password. If those are passed, you do not need to provide them when running the script. Use `-h` for more information: 

```
./jellyfindownloader -h

## Todo

- [x] Instead of fiddling with Ids, one should only provide the series name and episode number which should be downloaded
- [x] Retrieve the credentials via an environnement variable
- [x] Be able to search and download any media types, starting with movies
- [ ] Implement a selection for different seasons
- There are probably some other things which should be done whose will come to my mind later on
